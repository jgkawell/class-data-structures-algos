# Data Structures Class Projects
My programming assignments for CS210 Data Structures and Algorithms during the spring of 2016 at Samford University.

## Description of Projects

### Airport Simulator
#### Sonar Cloud: https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=com.jgkawell%3Aairport-simulator
The purpose of this program is to simulate the time behavior of airplanes arriving at an airport and waiting to land. Imagine that airplanes arrive at random intervals with a limited quantity of fuel which determines their position in the holding pattern. Airlines with less fuel are given landing priority over airlines with more fuel. The airport can accept a landing every two minutes. Each plane belongs to one of eight airlines (United, Southwest, Northwest, Continental, American, Frontier, Alaska, or Lufthansa), has a flight number (1000-9999), and an amount of fuel left upon arrival (expressed in minutes as an integer from 1 to 20), and an arrival time.

### Massive Integer Addition
#### Sonar Cloud: https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=com.jgkawell%3Amassive-integer-addition
This program takes two integers of any length and adds them together. It does this by taking in integers as strings and converting them to single numeral ints placed in a linked list. It then adds the values from the two addend lists into another linked list. It also prints out the two user entered addends and the resulting sum.

### Queen Game Solver
#### Sonar Cloud: https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=com.jgkawell%3Aqueen-game-solver
A program to play a simple game which positions N number of Queens on an NxN board for any positive value of N such that no Queens are in the same row, the same column, or along the same diagonal. The program prompts the user for the number of Queens, finds the solution (if it exists), and shows the result. It can also show the placements of each individual trial placements of the Queens on the user's request. Also included in the result is the number of boards evaluated by the algorithm.

### Recursive Image Manipulator
#### Sonar Cloud: https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=com.jgkawell%3Arecursive-image-manipulator
This is a program that reads a specified text file into a 2D character array. It then allows the user to change a specified character into another character and then recursively checks the surrounding characters to see if they match the original character and changes them as well if they match.

### Simple Array List Tester
#### Sonar Cloud: https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=com.jgkawell%3Asimple-array-list-tester
Multi function program that places user entered names and their corresponding hobbies into objects and then places them into an dynamic array list. It also allows the user to perform multiple different options to manipulate and view the objects.

### Simple Array Tester
#### Sonar Cloud: https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=com.jgkawell%3Asimple-array-tester
Multi function program that places user entered integers in an array and allows the user to run different functions on the data.

### Sorting Tester
#### Sonar Cloud: https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=com.jgkawell%3Asorting-tester
This is a program that creates a random array of objects that contain an integer, a double, and a string value. It then asks the user for how they would like to sort the array; over the integers, doubles, or strings. It then sorts the array in six different ways (quick, merge, iterative selection, iterative bubble, iterative insertion, and shell), prints  the sorted and unsorted array if the user chooses to, and shows the computation time of each sort.
